Problem of Drive_Cr_Rental_Data :

The Car Rental Service, a thriving enterprise with a rich history in providing quality vehicle rentals, is committed to continuous improvement in operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. With a legacy of adapting to market changes and customer needs, the company now seeks to embrace advanced analytics to deepen its understanding of rental dynamics and customer preferences.

This initiative requires a structured approach, breaking down the overarching goal into specific, analyzable segments:

Analysis should address the following key points:
- Revenue Contribution: Identify which car types are contributing the most and the least to our total revenue. 
- Revenue vs. Popularity Correlation: Assess whether the most popular car types are also the highest revenue generators.
- Seasonal Variations: Examine if certain car types are more popular during specific times of the year, contributing to seasonal variations in revenue.
- Profit Margin Analysis: If data on costs is available, calculate the profit margin for each car type and compare it with the revenue data to understand profitability.
- Recommendations for Fleet Management: Based on the analysis, provide recommendations on which car types the company should invest in or divest from to
maximize future revenue. 
- Predictive Insight: If possible, use historical data to predict future trends in car type popularity and revenue generation.
